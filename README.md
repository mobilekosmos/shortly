# URL Shorter

Small Android App showcasing the use of Kotlin, Retrofit2 consuming a REST API, different Jetpack components, MVVM, LiveData, DataBinding, Moshi, Kotlin Coroutines, Kotlin extension function, Kotlin Flow, persistent storage with Room, edge-to-edge layout, multiple screen sizes support, fonts usage and more.
- Data and presentation layer, no domain layer for now.
- No Jetpack compose for now.

All written by me to simply demo my knowledge.

*The used API to shorten URLs is a free one and sometimes it won't react as fast, this is not up to the implementation itself, just the server being slow.
